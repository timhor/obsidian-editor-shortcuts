# Code Editor Shortcuts

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin adds keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) commonly found in code editors such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

| Command                                          | Shortcut \*                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Insert line below                                | `Ctrl` + `Enter` \*\*      |
| Insert line above                                | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter` |
| Delete line                                      | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `K`     |
| Duplicate line                                   | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `D`     |
| Join line below to current line                  | `Ctrl` + `J`               |
| Select line (repeat to keep expanding selection) | `Ctrl` + `L`               |
| Go to start of line                              | Not set                    |
| Go to end of line                                | Not set                    |
| Transform selection to uppercase                 | Not set                    |
| Transform selection to lowercase                 | Not set                    |
| Transform selection to title case                | Not set                    |

\* On macOS, replace `Ctrl` with `Cmd`

\*\* This may conflict with the default shortcut for _Toggle checklist status_; changing/removing one of the bindings is recommended
